The Fox matrix multiplication algorithm is an efficient approach for multiplying large matrices divided into blocks. It is based on the technique of block matrix multiplication and is designed to make the most of parallelism in distributed computing architectures. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to use the Fox matrix multiplication algorithm:

Imagine you have two square matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of size \\(n \\times n\\), and you want to multiply them to obtain the matrix \\(C\\).

## Block Division of Matrices

Divide the square matrices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) into blocks. Suppose you decide to divide each matrix into blocks of size \\(b \\times b\\).

## Distribution of Blocks Among Processors

Assign blocks of matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to different processors. Each processor will handle a set of blocks.

## Initialization

Initialize matrix \\(C\\) on each processor with zeros.

## Main Loop

Perform a main loop consisting of several steps:

### Local Multiplication

Each processor multiplies its local blocks of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and accumulates the result in the corresponding blocks of \\(C\\).

### Communication Between Processors

Blocks of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are exchanged between processors in a circular fashion. This allows each processor to obtain the necessary blocks for local multiplications.

### Update Blocks of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)

After each iteration, update the blocks of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to contain the necessary blocks for the next iteration.

## Completion of the Main Loop

Repeat the main loop until all blocks of matrix \\(C\\) have been calculated.

## Results Collection

After completing the main loop, each processor will have a portion of matrix \\(C\\). Use communication functions, such as MPI Allreduce, to combine and sum all parts of \\(C\\) across all processors.

## Final Result

The resulting matrix \\(C\\) contains the product of matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).

This approach leverages parallelization in distributed systems, where each processor performs independent calculations in parallel. The results are then combined to obtain the complete output matrix. The performance of this algorithm is particularly notable for large matrices.
